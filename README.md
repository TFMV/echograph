# EchoGraph

EchoGraph is a Go library that transforms structured data into dynamic, interactive, and surrealist visualizations. It combines force-directed graph layouts with artistic distortion to create unique visual representations of data.

## Features

- **Multiple Visualization Formats**: Generate SVG, WebGL (interactive), or ASCII art visualizations
- **Force-Directed Layouts**: Automatically arrange nodes using physics-based algorithms
- **Surrealist Effects**: Apply artistic distortions, color shifting, and Perlin noise
- **High Performance**: Uses Go's concurrency model for parallel computation
- **Interactive Mode**: WebGL visualizations with zoom, pan, and animation
